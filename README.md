This is a PyGame and Qiskit implementation of an educational game where the player learns how to build quantum circuits, understand familiar, quantum algorithms alongside classical algorithms, and solves a (rather poorly written) narrative where a salesman makes a proposal to rebuild the roads of a beleagured city in a fictional US state.

The game can be ran on Jupyter Notebook.
